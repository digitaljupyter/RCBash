RC is a separately branched fork of the RCP CLI.

H. Strings (1.0)

Strings have two different characters for a reason.

the quote (") is for basic strings, contains escapes, and allows long manipulation.

the italic (`) is for complex strings, it contains everything like the quote, except it
supports the use of the quote inside of it, and it wont be recognized.

H. Scripts

There's only one startup script, rcbrc.

you can add a bunch of things inside of it to run on startup.

H. Leave

There's a farewell message when you load RC for the first time.

It reads:

Welcome to RCBash!
To get started, you can use bash instead of the default terminal by
typing 'bash' if you have bash installed.

The next step is to Learn Your OS.

This uses all of your tools on your OS and doesn't contain any custom utilities.

It's just a BASH for simplistic users.

You can choose different default shells and more in the .rcbrc file. RCBash Is yours!

it basically tells you how to set a default shell and tells you how to use bash.

If the default shell isn't enough (like you need expressions, comparisons, files, etc ...) you can
use the bash or zshell.
