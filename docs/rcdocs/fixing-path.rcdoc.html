<h1>Fixing RCBash Path Issues</h1>
<p>RCBash is written in Python, and uses local libraries to write data specially.</p>
<p>The way to use the RCBash.py globally, is by setting PYTHONPATH to the directory of RCBash.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><b>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/YOU/RCBash</b></p>
<p>This will allow RCBash to run the "RCScript" Library (a dependency for RCBash, RCBash is just the loader, RCScript is the official base lib)</p>
