Customized Plugin Commit

In your PluginManage, there's a feature that new-plugins branch adds called the "Advanced Commit" feature.
Essentially it allows you to single install addons.

Example: say you wanted to install a custom addon from another user. You'd download the repository and CD into it.

After, you'd use PluginManage from the local plugin directory.

[ /home/kaigonzalez/RCBash/TestPlug ] $ sudo PluginManage commit -d -s myplugin -l 

Using advanced commit
installing from directory plugins/
Checking for directory plugins and loading plugin myplugin.
Found plugins, single-load myplugin
Found myplugin, adding to Plugins!

This would then load the plugin.

You can see the test Plugin at /TestPlug in GitHub.
