Customized Plugin Commit

In your PluginManage, there's a feature that new-plugins branch adds called the "Advanced Commit" feature.
Essentially it allows you to single install addons.

Example: say you wanted to install a custom addon from another user. You'd download the repository and CD into it.

After, you'd use PluginManage from the local plugin directory using "sudo PluginManage commit -d -s myplugin -l"

sudo: Superuser do
PluginManage: The pluginmanage Software.
commit -d: Commit an advanced operation. '-d' checks and confirms it's what you want to do.
-s myplugin: -s selects a plugin.
-l: use a local directory.

English:
    Run PluginManage as superuser and commit an advanced operation selecting 
    and installing "myplugin" using the local install directory.


[ /home/kaigonzalez/RCBash/TestPlug ] $ sudo PluginManage commit -d -s myplugin -l 
                                                              
Using advanced commit
installing from directory plugins/
Checking for directory plugins and loading plugin myplugin.
Found plugins, single-load myplugin
Found myplugin, adding to Plugins!

This would then load the plugin.

You can see the test Plugin at /TestPlug in GitHub.
