Addon Creation

This episode we'll create an addon called "initialfetch" which will send system specs

like the RD Command.

Initialfetch will call neofetch, similar to how it would be done in the RC file.

Example:

import subprocess

VERSION='0.0.1'

def pluginInit(env):
    subprocess.run(['neofetch'])
    

def exitPlugin():
    pass

This is equivalent to adding

'neofetch'

to your RC File.

This was mainly to show how easy it is in python VS RC. And the flexibility Python gives you.
