Here's how to install shell-specific softwares into rcbash

1. Changing Shell

You can download or use specific shell aliases from (bash, sh, etc ...) by using it's command.

It's highlighted in the .rcbrc local file.

:
# UNCOMMENT TO SET BASH AS DEFAULT SHELL!!!
# set default /bin/bash

# UNCOMMENT TO SET ZSH AS DEFAULT SHELL!!!
# set default /bin/zsh
:

The 'default' variable is for loading another shell instead of the default command processor.
