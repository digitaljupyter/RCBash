Plugins 

The PluginManage tool is a simple utility for installing Plugins into RCBash, you're basically
creating a preload function, which not many other bashes have. Except for RCs.

Plugins VS the RCBRC are different, as the RCBRC supports only RCBScript code, and Plugins allow Python code.

ONLY INSTALL PYTHON EXTENSIONS FROM TRUSTED SITES & PEOPLE!

Python code could be anything. Please be careful!

Plugins are usually local, but you can install extra plugins soon with the PluginDownload tool.
